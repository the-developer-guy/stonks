Realtime trading game

Why code another hangman or number guessing game, if you can follow a much cooler app?

## Goal

The project aims to make a trading simulator, so you can test your skills and knowledge about the market without losing everything you have!

It's an example project for Python. The target audience is the people who try to learn the language and/or new tricks. I want to show how real development looks like, because the video series is just lightly scripted. Yes, even mistakes can (and will) happen! Learn from them.

The first revision will only include cryptocurrencies, but if I can manage to get a proper (and free) stock API, other commodities will be supported too.

## Requirements

1. Install Python: [Python.org downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Preferably create a virtual environment (python -m venv .venv)
3. Install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)
4. Start the application (python main.py)
